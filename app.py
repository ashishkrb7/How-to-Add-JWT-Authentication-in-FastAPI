"""
FastAPI Authentication Endpoints

This script contains the FastAPI endpoints responsible for user authentication and user-related actions. It includes the following endpoints:

1. /signup:
   - Method: POST
   - Summary: Create a new user.
   - Description: This endpoint allows users to sign up by providing their email and password. It checks if the user already exists in the database and raises an HTTPException if the user already has an account. If the user is new, their data is hashed, and a unique identifier (UUID) is generated for the user. The user's data is then saved to the database.
   - Response Model: UserOut (User output model containing user's email and unique identifier).

2. /login:
   - Method: POST
   - Summary: Create access and refresh tokens for the user.
   - Description: This endpoint allows users to log in using their email and password. It verifies the user's credentials by checking the hashed password against the one stored in the database. If the credentials are valid, the endpoint generates and returns both an access token and a refresh token for the user. These tokens can be used for authentication in subsequent requests.
   - Response Model: TokenSchema (Schema for JWT tokens containing access_token and refresh_token attributes).

3. /me:
   - Method: GET
   - Summary: Get details of the currently logged-in user.
   - Description: This endpoint requires a valid JWT access token to be provided in the Authorization header. It uses the get_current_user dependency (SystemUser) to extract and validate the user's information from the token payload. If the token is valid and the user is found in the database, their details are returned in the response.
   - Response Model: UserOut (User output model containing user's email and unique identifier).

4. /reset_email:
   - Method: POST
   - Summary: Reset user's email address.
   - Description: This endpoint allows users to reset their email address and update their password. It requires the user's current email address, new email address, current password, and new password. It verifies the provided credentials and updates the user's data in the database.
   - Response Model: UserOut (User output model containing updated email and unique identifier).
